This scripts put all the data comming from sensors from this study http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones into a tidy datasets and after that it summarize all the information grouping by activity and subject obtaining their mean of each variable.

Those are the steps of the script:

  * Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  * Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  * Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  * Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  * Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
